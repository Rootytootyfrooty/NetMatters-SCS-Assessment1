The hero image/first carousel:
	Title is not the same thickness, I've tried <strong> and <b> tags,
	I'm using the same Poppins font, with the font size and font weight matching (4rem, 600)
	As well as line height and letter spacing (5rem, 0.4px)
	
Nav bar: 
	I can't figure out how to apply the larger ::after triangle only to the first tab (con-dev) on hover for the md breakpoint
	Failed attempts can be seen in the nav-bar partial
	
Checkbox/consent/contact:
	The notes mentioned styling a checkbox, I can't seem to find one on the target NetMatters site
	Ditto for the Manage Consent and contact icon; I can't see any on the target site.

Our services:
	The spacing between the Our Services h2 and the View Our Work anchor is kind of botched.
	The target site isn't perfectly aligned on the y axis
	I used margin-bottom: -50px; ...at least it looks...okay.
 >>> at ~1855px screen width, the view all button ends up beside the our services grid
	I added a div box at the LG breakpoint and removed the bottom margin for the our services/view all text
	
Welcome section:
	At LG and MD breakpoints, the buttons aren't aligned with each other at the bottom of the section
	
Footer:
	LG breakpoint- ULs are not as wide as the target site, and I can't seem to change it
	
News:
	The articles move up with the right 0.5s transition but then snap back when hover is removed, instead of a 0.5s transition
	
View all buttons mobile:
	Mobile viewport 'view all' buttons don't extend the underline on hover to the arrow, it only underlines the word.
