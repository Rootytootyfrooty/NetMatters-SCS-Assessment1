<b>Our services:</b>
	The spacing between the Our Services h2 and the View Our Work anchor is kind of botched.
	The target site isn't perfectly aligned on the y axis.
	I used margin-bottom: -50px; ...at least it looks...okay.
 > at ~1855px screen width, the view all button ends up beside the our services grid.
	I added a div box at the LG breakpoint and removed the bottom margin for the our services/view all text.
	
	
<b>Footer:</b>
	LG breakpoint- ULs are not as wide as the target site, and I can't seem to change it.

<b>Favicon:</b>
Netmatters logo has transparent background now but it looks smaller than the target site.
