<b>Nav bar:</b> 
	I can't figure out how to apply the larger ::after triangle only to the first tab (con-dev) on hover for the md breakpoint.
	Failed attempts can be seen in the nav-bar partial.
  -Also the list items in the banners that appear on hover aren't layed out right, I'm having trouble centring all the text in relation to the icon.
	
<b>Checkbox/consent/contact:</b>
	The notes mentioned styling a checkbox, I can't seem to find one on the target NetMatters site.
	Ditto for the Manage Consent and contact icon; I can't see any on the target site.

<b>Our services:</b>
	The spacing between the Our Services h2 and the View Our Work anchor is kind of botched.
	The target site isn't perfectly aligned on the y axis.
	I used margin-bottom: -50px; ...at least it looks...okay.
 > at ~1855px screen width, the view all button ends up beside the our services grid.
	I added a div box at the LG breakpoint and removed the bottom margin for the our services/view all text.
	
<b>Welcome section:</b>
	At LG and MD breakpoints, the buttons aren't aligned with each other at the bottom of the section.
	
<b>Footer:</b>
	LG breakpoint- ULs are not as wide as the target site, and I can't seem to change it.
	
<b>View all buttons mobile:</b>
	Mobile viewport 'view all' buttons don't extend the underline on hover to the arrow, it only underlines the word.
